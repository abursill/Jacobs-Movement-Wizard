Details: Indicator for detecting short term chnages in the market trend.
Other Details: My website is currently under construcion.

Please read all the information below. it is very important.

Quadcode script for three moving averages.
 
The default settings work well, but best used on 3 hour and 30 minute charts to detect solid changes in the current market trend.
During testing found to work best with 2-3 minute options. With 1 minute options seems 70-30 that a reversal could occur and result in loss.

Please be warned this indicator is not 100% guaranteed to make you money.

So far this tool has only been tested while trading 1-3 minute options. I would not advise using it to predict a longer timeframe.

IMPORTANT:
Please be aware that as soon as these lines cross there is often a very slight reversal in the opposite direction. So please make sure you wait to see if the slight reversal happens before placing any trade.

Any strong crossover through the 300 EMA yellow line is an indication of complete trend reversal, but can also be am indication of the market testing a point of suppport ot resistance before reversing and continuing the current trend..
