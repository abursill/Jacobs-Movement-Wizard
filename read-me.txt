Details: Indicator for detecting short term chnages in the market trend.
Other Details: My website is currently under construcion.

Please read all the information below. it is very important.

Quadcode script for three moving averages.
 
The default settings work well, but best used on 3 hour and 30 minute charts to detect solid changes in the current market trend.
During testing found to work best with 1-2 minute options. With 1 minute options seems 70-30 that a reversal could occur and result in loss.

Please be warned this indicator is not 100% guaranteed to make you money.

So far this tool has only been tested while trading 1-3 minute options. I would not advise using it to predict a longer timeframe. 

How to read this indicator with its default settings.

Defaul Settings:
2 EMA blue line indicates bullish strength.
7 EMA red line indicates weakness.
300 EMA yellow line. Shows the longtern current direction of the trend.

The 2,7,300 settings work well for short term changes, on a 30 and 15 minute chart but you need to make sure they have strong approaches to the crossover. Also best to use with fibonacci Lines.  

Additional Reccommended Settings: 
25 EMA blue line indicates bullish strength.
100 EMA red line indicates weakness.
300 EMA yellow line. Shows the longtern current direction of the trend.

The 25,100,300 settings work well to detect strong movements, on a 3hour and 30 minute chart but you need to make sure they have strong approaches to the crossover. Also best to use with fibonacci Lines. (This is not recommended for use with the OTC market unless there is a high volume of trading and strong movements.) 


I do not recommend using this tool on currency pairs, that are moving too slowly and have no solid upward and downward trends occuring.
I also do not recommend for use when a market is moing too fast and has a choppy fast up and downward movements. Though I would never recommend trading in these conditions anyway.

This tool is best used in a market that is moving in a range that has STRONG and STEADY upward and downward movements. It is also best to not fight the main trend as you will find sometimes that resistance will be your enemy.

Blue and red lines are above the yellow line the market is in a bullish upward trend. (Do NOT use this as an indication for any type of strong movement).

Blue and red lines are below the yellow line the market is in a bearish downward trend. (Do NOT use this as an indication for any type of strong movement).

IMPORTANT:
Please be aware that as soon as these lines cross there is often a very slight reversal in the opposite direction. So please make sure you wait to see if the slight reversal happens before placing any trade.

Any strong crossover through the 300 EMA yellow line is an indication of complete trend reversal, but can also be am indication of the market testing a point of suppport ot resistance before reversing and continuing the current trend..
