# Jacobs-Movement-Wizard
Quadcode script for three moving averages. Default settings work well, but best used on 3 hour, 30 minute or 15 minute charts to detect solid changes in the current market trend.
Please download the read-me.txt file also. It will help you to understand this indicator and how to use it. I hope that you find this indicator useful. 
For Stronger Trend Changes: 25,100,300 best used on a 30 minute chart.
For Short Term Trend Changes: 2.7.300 best used on a 30, 15 or 5 minute chart.
For Super strong Trend Changes: 2.50.200 crossovers between the 2 and 50 are only really strong when they cross and are above or below the 200ema.
If below only the downward crossovers the red coming down below the blue are strong. Ff above the 200ema only the upward crossovers are strong blue crossing over above the red.
The blue crossing above or below the 200ema are also strong. The red crossing below the 200 ema is often also a strong ondicator. When the red crosses above the 200ema there is little to no change.
